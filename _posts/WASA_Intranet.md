I am primarily responsible for designing the UI and developing the front-end using Next.js for a new web application aimed at managing the equipment utilized in robot production. This project addresses the challenges of storage management, which often becomes disorganized and cumbersome over time.

## OVERVIEW

We are creating this app using javascript and related libraries such as Next js, typescript and Redux.
The following images are the concepts of the app.

On the left is the search page, where we implement simple components like buttons and search bars using Shad-cn.
On the right is the map page, featuring an overall storage map built with SVG and enhanced with interactivity through the React Pan Zoom library.
In our future plans, we intend to integrate features such as authentication and messaging. For authentication, we're considering NextAuth, while for the backend database, we're currently transitioning from Firebase to Supabase.
