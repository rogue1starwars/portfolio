I was responsible for creating the frontend UI design and implementation with Next.js. I also created the 'Posts' section where users can add blog posts using microCMS.

[Take a look at the actual website](https://wasa-rocket.vercel.app/)

## OVERVIEW

We created a multi-page web site using Next.js App router.

## Figma

In order to create the UI design, we used Figma. The design has changed as the project went on, but the basic design was determined at this stage.

## Framer Motion

Some of the elements have animation built-in for better design. We used the Framer Motion library to implement all the animation.

## Logo Design

For the logo design, we used Clip Studio Paint and Figma to create a unique logo design for each of the projects. We made sure that all the logos have an iconic design related to the project.

## mico CMS

We wanted to allow other members of the club edit and add blog posts easily, so we connected our project with microCMS. By using this CMS service the user can Easily add and edit blog posts from the web, just like google docs.

## Deployment

We used Vercel to deploy this project. When using Vercel, the main branch of GitHub will automatically be deployed, so extra caution will be required to protect the main branch. In order to protect the main branch from critical issues, we used the GitHub flow method.
